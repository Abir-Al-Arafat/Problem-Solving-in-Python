## Quick Overview 🔍

- **Basic Ones/** — Beginner problems and small practice scripts (e.g., `armstrongNumber.py`, `palindromeString.py`, `reverseString.py`).
- **Data Structures and Algorithms/** — Implementations and examples for core DS & algorithms (Binary Search, Linked Lists, Heaps, Sorting, Graphs, BFS/DFS, Kadane's, etc.).
  - Subfolders: `Heaps/`, `Linked List/`, `Sorting/`.
- **Dictionary related problems/** — Exercises demonstrating dictionary usage and common patterns.
- **Dynamic Programming/** — Top-down and bottom-up DP patterns and backtracking examples.
- **Leetcode/** — Large, topic-organized collection of LeetCode problems (arrays, strings, trees, graphs, DP, intervals, heaps, sliding window, etc.).
- **List Related Problems/** — Focused list manipulation problems.
- **Object Oriented Programming/** — OOP examples and small projects (`BankAccount.py`, `ShoppingCart.py`, `Person.py`, etc.).
- **Recursion/** — Recursion and backtracking examples.
- **Reverse/** — Utilities and problems for reversing strings/numbers.
