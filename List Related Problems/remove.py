# Write a program that remove the items of given indices from the list. The list of indexes are as follows: [2,4]. Then create a new list that consists of all the strings from the userâ€™s list except for those at the indices from the list of indices. For instance, if the list of strings is ['a','bc','d','e','fg'] and the list of indices is[2,4], then the new list would be ['a','bc','e']. L= ['a','bc','d','e','fg'] I = [4,2]

inp = ['a', 'bc', 'd', 'e', 'fg']  # list of strings
index = [2, 4]  # list of indices whose elements need to be removed
j = 0  # initializing to 0 number index
out = []  # initializing an empty list

# running a for loop in the string
for i in range(len(inp)):
    # running a while loop in the index list
    while(j < len(index)):
        # appending value not according to the given index
        if(i != index[j]):
            out.append(inp[i])
            break
        # going to the next index
        else:
            j += 1
            break

print(out)
