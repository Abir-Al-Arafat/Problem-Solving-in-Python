# Write a program that uses two lists of the same length. Then create a new list where the entry at each index in the new list is the larger of the entries at index of the userâ€™s two lists. For instance, if the two lists are [1,25,3] and [18,2,30], then new list would be [18,25,30].
# L1 = [1,25,3]
# L2 = [18,2,30]

L1 = [1, 25, 3]
L2 = [18, 2, 30]

# declaring an empty list
largest = []

# running a for loop to iterate over items
for index in range(len(L1)):
    if L1[index] > L2[index]:
        largest.append(L1[index])
    else:
        largest.append(L2[index])

# printing the list
print(largest)
