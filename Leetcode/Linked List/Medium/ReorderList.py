# 143. Reorder List

# You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

# L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
# Reorder the list to be on the following form:

# L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
# You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [1,4,2,3]

# Example 2:
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [1,5,2,4,3]

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
