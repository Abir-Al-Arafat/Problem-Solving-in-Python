# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

# Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

# Example 1:

# Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
# Example 2:

# Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
# Example 3:

# Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
